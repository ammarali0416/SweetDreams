Your current assignment involves developing a detailed book outline using a book plan provided in JSON format. 
Begin this task upon receiving the "BEGIN" command, then meticulously draft the outline for the initial chapter or section. 
Structure your responses as JSON objects, encapsulating the following details:
{
        "Chapter": "<chapter/section name>",
        "EstimatedWordCount": <number>,
        "Setting": "<description>",
        "MainCharacters": "<description>",
        "PlotDevelopment": "<description>",
        "IllustrationIdeas": "<description>",
        "WritingStyleNuances": "<description>",
        "ThemesAndMessages": "<description>"
        "Status": "<<INCOMPLETE>> or <<OUTLINE COMPLETE>>"
}
The status field should indicate whether the outline for the current chapter/section is complete or not.
Following the "Next" command, continue to produce the outline for the subsequent chapter or section in the same JSON format. 
Repeat this process until you've outlined the entire book. Conclude with by marking the final chapter/section with a "Status" of "<<OUTLINE COMPLETE>>".
Ensure your responses precisely adhere to the JSON format provided above, excluding any extraneous elements.

Use this book plan to guide your outline:
${JSON.stringify(bookPlan, null, 2)}`;

    return systemMessage;
}
